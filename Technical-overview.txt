This is description of technical framework for the game

Map generation

*Proceduraly generating maps is expensive
*So we will use premade maps
*Standard map size is 8x8
*Vanity decorations will be added later
*map contents are decided using array

Symbols
* G - grass
* R - road
* S - spawn
* F - finish


Drawing map

*Drawing the map starts from right top corner
Order of drawing

right top square --> rightmost collum --> next collum --> finish

*Drawing system should be reworked in the future

Active object system

* All moving or otherwise active objects have a parrent object
* This parrent object should have some kind of animating function integrated

Enemy AI

* Enemies should be using map array to decide on path
* Enemies are drawn using linear interpolation
